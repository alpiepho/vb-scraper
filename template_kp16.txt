Dear Coach ${TEAM_COACH_NAME},
${TEAM_INTRO_SENTENCE} My name is Kaylee Piepho and I am the Setter for my 16 National team. 
We will be attending 3 USAV Qualifiers (Spokane, Chicago, Reno), the AAU Nationals in Orlando,
and hopefully USAV Nationals in Chicago.

As I look at schools, ${TEAM_NAME} is a great fit ${TEAM_FIT_REASON} and it has my top major PLAYER_MAJOR.
Everyone says they are a competitor, but here is what I am doing to improve myself -

1. I play 5-6 days a week - (6-10 hours of club practice and 1-3 hours of privates lessons)
2. Lifting weights 4x a week
3. I am working with a medical nutritionist to keep my body in optimal health
4. I play beach volleyball for Aspire Beach club 4-8 hrs a week during the summer to increase speed and strength
5. I work with a sports specialized mental toughness coach to help elevate my mental game

Here is some information about myself for you to review to see if I meet your initial criteria.
