overview: This is the Boise State University (Idaho) Volleyball scholarship and program information page. Here you can explore important information about Boise State University Volleyball. This information is very valuable for all high school student-athletes to understand as they start the recruiting process. Boise State University is located in Boise, ID and the Volleyball program competes in the Mountain West Conference (MW) conference.\n\nBoise State University does offer athletic scholarships for Volleyball. Need-based and academic scholarships are available for student-athletes. Athletic scholarships are available for NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NAIA and NJCAA. On average, 34% of all student-athletes receive athletic scholarships.\n\nIf you are interested in getting recruited by Boise State University Volleyball, you should get to know more about the school, what academic programs are offered, and important members of the coaching staff - these are the people you need to connect with. Getting familiar with the Volleyball program is an important first step in the recruiting process.\n\nHow to get recruited by Boise State University Volleyball\n\nMost college Volleyball coaches don’t respond to unsolicited emails. It’s important you build a relationship with the coaching staff. This is one of the ways SportsRecruits can help. You can certainly start by filling out the Boise State University Volleyball’s recruiting questionnaire and getting on their list, but that’s only the start. To get actively recruited, a college coach needs to see you compete, which is why it’s important to have an online athletic recruiting profile.
