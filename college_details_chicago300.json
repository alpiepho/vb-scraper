Getting familiar with the Volleyball program is an important first step in the recruiting process.\n\nHow to get recruited by Lincoln College Volleyball\n\nMost college Volleyball coaches don’t respond to unsolicited emails. It’s important you build a relationship with the coaching staff. This is one of the ways SportsRecruits can help.

To get actively recruited, a college coach needs to see you compete, which is why it’s important to have an online athletic recruiting profile.

Just having a recruiting profile doesn’t guarantee you will get recruited. You need your profile to showcase all of your academic and athletic achievements, and be able to instantly connect to college coaches who are interested.

Need-based and academic scholarships are available for student-athletes. Athletic scholarships are available for NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NAIA and NJCAA. On average, 34% of all student-athletes receive athletic scholarships.\n\nIf you are interested in getting recruited by Principia College Volleyball, you should get to know more about the school, what academic programs are offered, and important members of the coaching staff - these are the people you need to connect with. Getting familiar with the Volleyball program is an important first step in the recruiting process.\n\nHow to get recruited by Principia College Volleyball\n\nMost college Volleyball coaches don’t respond to unsolicited emails. It’s important you build a relationship with the coaching staff. This is one of the ways SportsRecruits can help. You can certainly start by filling out the Principia College Volleyball’s recruiting questionnaire and getting on their list, but that’s only the start. To get actively recruited, a college coach needs to see you compete, which is why it’s important to have an online athletic recruiting profile.

Just having a recruiting profile doesn’t guarantee you will get recruited. You need your profile to showcase all of your academic and athletic achievements, and be able to instantly connect to college coaches who are interested. If you can’t quickly find and message any college coach you want, then you’re not solving your biggest problem in getting recruited for Volleyball. The Head Coach of Principia College Volleyball is Geoffrey Davis - make it as easy as possible for them to learn about you as an athlete, and be able to start a conversation with you. 100% of college coaches and programs are on the SportsRecruits platform.

This information is very valuable for all high school student-athletes to understand as they start the recruiting process. Trine University is located in Angola, IN and the Volleyball program competes in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) conference.\n\nTrine University does not offer athletic scholarships for Volleyball. Need-based and academic scholarships are available for student-athletes. Athletic scholarships are available for NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NAIA and NJCAA.
