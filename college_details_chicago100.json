This information is very valuable for all high school student-athletes to understand as they start the recruiting process. Aurora University is located in Aurora, IL and the Volleyball program competes in the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC) conference.\n\nAurora University does not offer athletic scholarships for Volleyball. Need-based and academic scholarships are available for student-athletes. Athletic scholarships are available for NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NAIA and NJCAA.

You can certainly start by filling out the Aurora University Volleyball’s recruiting questionnaire and getting on their list, but that’s only the start. To get actively recruited, a college coach needs to see you compete, which is why it’s important to have an online athletic recruiting profile.
