Dear Coach Walters,
Congratulations on a winning season and getting 7th seed in the NCAA Tournament! My name is Jane Davis and I am the libero and team captain for my 15 National team that is headed to AAU Nationals (Premier Div.) and then USAV Nationals (National Div.). As I look at schools, Palm Beach Atlantic University is a great fit as I have family in Florida, am familiar with the area and it has my top majors Management and Business Administration.
Everyone says they are a competitor, but here is what I am doing to improve myself -

1. I play 6-7 days a week - (6-10 hours of club practice and 1-3 hours of privates with International Player Sonia Newcomb)
2. Lifting weights 2-3x a week and a 1 hr of D1 level agility program
3. I am working with a medical nutritionist to keep my body in optimal health
4. I play beach volleyball for Aspire Beach club 4-8 hrs a week during the summer to increase speed and strength
5. I work with a sports specialized mental toughness coach to help elevate my mental game

Here is some information about myself for you to review to see if I meet your initial criteria.
(For future updates please look at my profile on https://www.varsityathlete.com/JaneDavis)
I am working on a highlight video from this season which will be done when I get the footage from these last two tournaments. I will send a follow up email with the link when it is ready.
